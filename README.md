# Circuit-Simulator-Project
:star:This repository is the end of year project of Imperial College London EIE department in Year 1. 

The project is selected as the best Circuit Simulator Project (overall Runner-Up Award) among the cohort. 

The circuit simulator reads an input file (i.e. sample files listed in the /test folder) that defines the circuit and the simulation. The format of the input file is compatible with SPICE.
